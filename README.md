So my general idea is to make a survival top down shooter game

to make it relative to the theme "Unintended Consequences"

My ideas:
1. for example if the player shoot it will attract more enemies?
2. similar to quiet place I think? if you make noise it will attract enemies
   - like drinking potion
   - reloading
   -
